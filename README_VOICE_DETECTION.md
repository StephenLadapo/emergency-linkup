# University of Limpopo Emergency Voice Detection System

This document describes the AI-powered voice recognition system built for the University of Limpopo Emergency System that continuously monitors for emergency phrases and triggers instant alerts.

## Features

### üéØ Core Functionality
- **Continuous Voice Monitoring**: Runs in the background listening for emergency phrases
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Uses both Web Speech API and Hugging Face Transformers
- **Offline Capability**: Includes Whisper model for offline speech recognition
- **Real-time Alerts**: Instant notifications when emergency phrases are detected
- **Audio Recording**: Captures audio clips around emergency detections
- **GPS Location**: Automatically includes location data with alerts

### üö® Emergency Categories
- **Medical**: "help me", "I'm hurt", "call an ambulance", "chest pain", etc.
- **Security**: "call security", "I'm being followed", "intruder", "robbery", etc.  
- **Fire**: "fire", "smoke", "building is on fire", etc.
- **General**: "emergency", "help", "urgent help needed", "SOS", etc.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
- **Custom Phrases**: Add/remove emergency phrases via the UI
- **Confidence Levels**: Adjustable detection sensitivity per phrase
- **Category Management**: Organize phrases by emergency type
- **Detection History**: View past detections with audio playback

## Usage

### Getting Started
1. Navigate to **Dashboard ‚Üí Audio Recording**
2. Click **"Start Detection"** to begin voice monitoring
3. The system will request microphone permissions
4. Once active, it continuously listens for emergency phrases

### Adding Custom Phrases
1. In the Emergency Phrases section, enter a new phrase
2. Select the appropriate category (Medical, Security, Fire, General)
3. Click the **+** button to add
4. The phrase will be immediately active for detection

### Emergency Detection Flow
1. **Detection**: System identifies an emergency phrase in speech
2. **Location**: Automatically captures GPS coordinates (if available)
3. **Audio Clip**: Records 30 seconds of audio around the detection
4. **Alert**: Shows browser notification and plays alert sound
5. **Logging**: Saves detection to history with timestamp and details

## Mobile Deployment (Capacitor)

This system is configured for mobile deployment using Capacitor for both Android and iOS.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Android Studio (for Android deployment)
- Xcode (for iOS deployment, macOS only)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Export to GitHub** (via Lovable interface)
2. **Clone and Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd [project-name]
   npm install
   ```

3. **Add Mobile Platforms**:
   ```bash
   npx cap add android
   npx cap add ios
   ```

4. **Build and Sync**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx cap sync
   ```

5. **Run on Device/Emulator**:
   ```bash
   # For Android
   npx cap run android
   
   # For iOS (macOS only)
   npx cap run ios
   ```

### Mobile-Specific Features
- **Background Processing**: Continues monitoring when app is minimized
- **Native Notifications**: Uses device notification system
- **Battery Optimization**: Efficient resource usage for all-day monitoring
- **Permission Handling**: Proper microphone and location permissions

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
EmergencyVoiceRecognition.ts (Core Engine)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Web Speech API (Primary recognition)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Whisper Model (Offline fallback)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Audio Recording (MediaRecorder API)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Location Services (Geolocation API)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Emergency Detection (Pattern matching)

EmergencyVoiceDetector.tsx (React Component)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Control Interface (Start/Stop detection)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phrase Management (Add/Remove phrases)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Detection History (View past alerts)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Audio Playback (Review detection clips)
```

### Default Emergency Phrases (26 total)

**Medical (8 phrases)**:
- "help me", "I'm hurt", "I need medical help"
- "call an ambulance", "medical emergency"
- "I can't breathe", "chest pain", "heart attack"

**Security (7 phrases)**:
- "call security", "help me please"
- "someone is attacking me", "I'm being followed"
- "intruder", "robbery", "call the police"

**Fire (4 phrases)**:
- "fire", "smoke", "building is on fire"
- "call fire department"

**General (7 phrases)**:
- "emergency", "help", "urgent help needed"
- "call for help", "mayday", "SOS"

### Performance Optimizations
- **Chunked Processing**: Audio processed in 10-second chunks
- **WebGPU Acceleration**: Uses WebGPU for Whisper model when available
- **Efficient Pattern Matching**: Optimized phrase detection algorithms
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of audio buffers
- **Battery Conscious**: Minimal resource usage for continuous operation

## Configuration Files

### Emergency Phrases Config
Custom phrases are stored in localStorage and can be exported/imported:
```json
{
  "phrase": "custom emergency phrase",
  "category": "medical|security|fire|general", 
  "confidence": 0.8
}
```

### Capacitor Configuration
The `capacitor.config.ts` file is pre-configured for the University of Limpopo project:
- App ID: `app.lovable.956b9256554f442eba4010015872a126`
- App Name: `emergency-linkup`
- Splash screen with UL branding
- Notification settings optimized for emergency alerts

## Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- **Local Processing**: Voice recognition happens on-device
- **No Cloud Storage**: Audio clips stored locally only
- **Privacy First**: No voice data sent to external servers
- **Secure Storage**: Emergency history encrypted in localStorage

### Permissions Required
- **Microphone**: Continuous audio monitoring
- **Location**: GPS coordinates for emergency alerts
- **Notifications**: Browser/system notifications for alerts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Speech recognition not supported"**
- Ensure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- Check microphone permissions in browser settings

**"No audio detected"**
- Verify microphone is working and not muted
- Check system audio levels
- Try refreshing the page and restarting detection

**"WebGPU not available"**
- Fallback to Web Speech API is automatic
- No impact on core functionality

### Browser Support
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support (recommended)
- **Firefox**: Web Speech API support varies
- **Safari**: Good support on macOS/iOS
- **Mobile Browsers**: Full support via Capacitor

## Development

### Adding New Features
The system is designed to be extensible:
- Add new emergency categories in `EmergencyPhrase` interface
- Extend pattern matching in `calculatePhraseMatch()` 
- Add new alert channels in `sendEmergencyAlert()`
- Integrate with backend emergency services

### Testing
Test the system by:
1. Speaking emergency phrases clearly into the microphone
2. Verifying detection appears in history
3. Checking alert notifications appear
4. Testing audio clip playback
